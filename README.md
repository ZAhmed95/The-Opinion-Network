# The-Opinion-Network
Tell the world your opinions on various things. Simple as that.

The way it works: one user posts a poll regarding a particular topic ("what do you think of this guy?", "The weather today, am I right?", "Dogs are better than cats. Go!"), and other users enthusiastically agree, vehemntly oppose, or 'meh' that particular topic by using the opinion scale.
